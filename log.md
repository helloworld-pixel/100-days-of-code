# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2020
**Today's Progress**:- Started with TOP (The Odin Project). Did some basic initial reading which included but not limited to:
-Motivational Text
-Time Management Techniques
    -Pomodoro
    -Lizard man smthing
-Real life experiences of people who started out in the web dev community and hustled theirway forward

To ensure that I stick to my commitment and myself in check, I plan to do the following things:
- installed [HabitHub](https://thehabithub.com/): A real good app to virtually make any habbit possible. I like the clean interface.
- installed [Boosted](https://www.boostedproductivity.com/): I use this app to keep a track of the the number of hours that I spend each day on my goals.
- installed [Asana](https://asana.com/): I'll use this to plan my upcoming *tasks*.
- installed [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/): This service is used by me to save any supplement pages that I want read in my free time. 

**Thought's**:- On the very first day I figured it out that making *schedule* is very essential. Today I woke up at around 2 PM and the the rest of the day just went down the drain. Still I was able to put in 50+ mins.Most of the time went into setting up stuff.

### Day 1: 26 June 2020
**Today's Progress**:- The second day was mostly spent on going through the community forums. I added a few more relevant channels on my personal discord server
so that others who are starting out with me on the #100DaysOfCode challenge can commuunicate effectively and send in their daily progress.I learned to use the concept of webhooks and applied that on my discord server and by doing this I was successsfully able to automate the task of providing daily updates. Also, I've decided to put in a section that'll number of hours that I'll be putting in to code. 

**Thoughts**:- I was successfully able to wake up early in the morning. It was tough for me to pull through the day as my body was still taking time to adjusting to the new schedule. A couple of people from my group also joined me in the challenge. Overall it was a productive day.

**No. of hours spent learning**:- 1 hour 16 minutes
